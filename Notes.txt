/// EOF
Ctrl + z than Enter

/// break after default case
Add break to the default case - > best practice

/// for (; ; ) -> infinite loop
no test = true, could be broken by return / break

/// ctype
verify the type, return 1 if is true. exemple isspace, isdegit.

/// strtol
convert string to long integer

/// comma ,
could be used for the exchange of elements

/// contine
apply only in the loops, not switch
while ()
    switch ()
    {
        continue; -> causes the next loop iteration
    };

/// function argument
if function take arguments declare them
if function takes no argument use void

/// external variable
if the variable is to be referred before i's declaration, if it is
defined in a different source file from the one where it is being used
then extern declaration is mandatory

/// static variable
allocate a fix storage in RAM to static variable,
data can't lose when the function funish.

/// register variable
advise the compiler that the variable is heavily used.
the register variable are to be placed in register machine.
may resut in smaller and faster program.
note that compilers are free to ignore the advice.

/// initialization
absence of explicit initialization.
static & extern are initialiezed to 0
automatic & register variables have undefined (i.e., garbage) initial values.
